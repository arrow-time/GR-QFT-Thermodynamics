# GR-QFT-Thermodynamics

This article mainly discusses the current major challenges in unifying general relativity, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics — primarily from a personal perspective.

1.Issues regarding spatial topology, black hole singularity paradoxes, and ultraviolet divergences all suggest that the mathematical concept of infinite approximation may not hold in the real world. In other words, infinite proximity within spherical neighborhoods — or infinitely adjacent structures — likely do not represent the true topological configuration of physical space.

2.The time-asymmetry (or "arrow of time") inherent in thermodynamics is not reflected in either general relativity or quantum field theory. This constitutes an unavoidable issue concerning the internal consistency of GR and QFT.

3.The issue of locality versus non-locality: The observational foundations, theoretical basis, and logical structures of general relativity, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics are all built upon strict locality and the speed-of-light constraint. Currently, the only experimental observations that might challenge this assumption are related to Bell’s inequality experiments; however, whether these experiments truly imply the existence of non-locality remains controversial.
In fact, general relativity, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics are fundamentally incompatible with non-locality.

Once non-locality is introduced,

3.1 It would directly cause general relativity, quantum field theory (including path integrals), and even the three laws of thermodynamics to break down, leading to a collapse of the entire foundation of physics.

3.2 Non-locality leads to an exponential increase in the complexity of system evolution, far exceeding human computational capacity. Both computability and observability become problematic — in other words, such phenomena cannot be verified or falsified, remaining merely abstract mathematical deductions.

3.3 Therefore, even if certain non-locality-related hypotheses were correct, they would have little practical significance for humans, as they are neither computable nor predictable, and cannot be falsified.

Therefore, to unify general relativity, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics, we must still proceed strictly within the framework of locality.

To achieve this unification, the first step is to embed the thermodynamic arrow of time into models of general relativity and quantum field theory. Then, by introducing a discrete structure, we can eliminate singularities and ultraviolet divergences — that is, replace the differential geometric model based on infinite approximation and infinite adjacency with a discrete topological configuration.

To accomplish this, the most critical issue is determining The Adjacency Topology of Space itself.

It may be extremely difficult to obtain the Planck-scale spatial adjacency topology through high-energy particle physics. On the other hand, using cosmological observations — especially neutron star and black hole observations, gravitational wave spectrum analysis, dark energy density distribution, and other macroscopic observations — to infer the spatial adjacency topology appears to be a more promising direction.

What follows is my attempt to embed the thermodynamic arrow of time into general relativity and quantum field theory via a quantized elastic space model, although a specific spatial adjacency topology has not yet been explicitly defined:
